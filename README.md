# Simulations to estimate π
[![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8.8-blue)](https://www.python.org/)
## Project Description
Pi is an irrational number, and thus it can never be written as a fraction of two whole numbers, and its decimal expansion therefore does not terminate or repeat. No exact value of Pi has been found. There are only approximations of Pi which have been recorded which sometimes result in an error when performing precised calculations. This project is aimed at estimating π using some randomness via Monte Carlo Methods. We also aim to look at convergence of different methods estimating Pi analysed using different numbers of sample points during simulation procedure and then averaging over these independent approximations. I’ll implement eight versions to do this.

## How to Install and Run the Project

### Install

* Since the script uses Anaconda Distribution of python, user must first install Anaconda according to their system requirements [from here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). The instructions to install can be [found here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/#). After the installation, open Anaconda Navigator and click Launch on the [Jupyter Notebook](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/) application.

  *Note that Jupyter python script as an extension of **.pynb** unlike **.py** for other python scripts. So the user should open the script using Jupyter Notebook.*

* Afterwards, the user must clone the Git repository on the local machine. On the GitHub, navigate to the repository, select the ***Code*** button (in green) and then select the button beside the link to copy the repository link.

 * If you chose to copy the link, then open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to copy the repository using `cd PATH-TO_DIRECTORY`. Type git clone then paste the link to the repository you copied earlier.
 
  ```
   git clone URL-OF-REPOSITORY
  ```
  
  * Lastly, go to the Jupyter Notebook launched earlier and navigate to the directory where you copied the repo or where you downloaded the ZIP. Select the project folder and double click on the ***ACM40960_Project_21200378.pynb*** file to open it in Jupyter Notebook.


### Running the Script

The Jupyter file should be run chronologically. Failure to do so may result in errors. To execute a code block, select the block (a blue bar is displayed on the left of the code block), then either press `Shift + Return` or press the *play button (RUN)* on the toolbar above. Also, from the Cells Menu you can select Run Cells to run the code block.

*Note: Some of the code blocks take longer to run. The runtimes (in seconds) for Additional Simulations are as follows:*
