# Simulations to estimate π
[![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8.8-blue)](https://www.python.org/)
## Project Description
Pi is an irrational number, and thus it can never be written as a fraction of two whole numbers, and its decimal expansion therefore does not terminate or repeat. No exact value of Pi has been found. There are only approximations of Pi which have been recorded which sometimes result in an error when performing precised calculations. This project is aimed at estimating π using some randomness via Monte Carlo Methods. We also aim to look at convergence of different methods estimating Pi analysed using different numbers of sample points during simulation procedure and then averaging over these independent approximations. I’ll implement eight versions to do this.
